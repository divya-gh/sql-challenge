All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.I will design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. In other words, you will perform:- Data Engineering- Data Analysis.### Objectives - Create a new repository __'EmployeeSQL'__ in GitHub and load Engineering and Analysis files.#### Data Modeling - Inspect the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables using [QuickDB-ERD](http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com).#### Data Engineering- Create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. - Specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.	### Data Analysis1. List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.2. List first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.3. List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department    name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name.4. List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name,      first name, and department name.5. List first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin    with "B."6. List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name,     and department name.7. List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last     name, first name, and department name.8. In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share    each last name.### Bonus - Generate a visualization of the data:	* Import the SQL database into Pandas using sqlalchemy.	* Create a histogram to visualize the most common salary ranges for employees.	* Create a bar chart of average salary by title.#### Epilogue - What's hidden in the database with the ID no. "499942" ?## Observations and Insights ### Data Modeling- Following schema file was created using [QuickDB-ERD](http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com) .         ![ERD Diagram](./EmployeeSQL/Data-Modeling-ERD/PH_ERDiagram.png)   #### Data Engineering- Following table schema was created for each of the six CSV files  - [Schema File](/EmployeeSQL/Data-Modeling-ERD/PH_ERD-Schema.sql)   #### Data Analysis- Following queries were generated for analysis- [Querry File](/EmployeeSQL/Data_Analysis/PH_querry.sql)	 ### Bonus - 1.
